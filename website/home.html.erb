  </header>

  <p>
    I live in Rochester, NY and I work as a web developer at <a href="https://stridenyc.com" rel="noopener">Stride Consulting</a>.
    I write about technology at <a href="https://merimerimeri.com" rel="noopener">merimerimeri.com</a> and about other things
    on <a href="writings.html">this website</a>. I host a <a href="https://themodern.fm" rel="noopener">podcast</a> with
    my best friend, and I'm usually working on one of the projects listed below. Oh, and I'm dating <a href="https://www.malaynahocker.com" rel="noopener">Malayna Hocker</a>.
    I ‚ù§Ô∏è the web.

      A History of my Income</a> - A few years ago I started publishing my income online for anyone to see. We don't
      really talk about money and that leads to unequity. I wanted to do my small part to bend the arc towards fairness.

      <a href="https://locallycurated.com" rel="noopener">Locally Curated</a> - An online bookshelf for companies
      I'm building Locally Curated with a friend. We think that a company's bookshelf tells a story, about who they are
      and what they believe. We want to help companies tell that story.

      <a href="https://rochestertutoring.com" rel="noopener">Rochester Tutoring</a> - A simple tutoring website
      I built to help my girlfriend find people to tutor. We printed out signs and posted them around the local undergraduate
      campus. It was a lot of fun and it worked!

    <li class="mb-4">
      <a href="https://themodern.fm" rel="noopener">The Modern Podcast Network</a> - A podcast network I started
      with a friend. We only have a few podcasts, but we're growing!
