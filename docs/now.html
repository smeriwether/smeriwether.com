    <p>Experiences in the last few days have left me feeling overwhelmingly sad. As I&rsquo;ve been thinking about those experiences, and the experiences of the last few months a couple of things have started to emerge.</p>

<p><strong>Being alone</strong></p>

<p>One of my biggest fears was not knowing how I was going to cope with the isolation. The last time I faced this kind of isolation was when I first moved to New York, and I was incredibly lonely. I feared the same would happen this time. I&rsquo;m still not sure how it&rsquo;s going to go. I&rsquo;ve been warned by friends that the path has many twists and turns, and that more really hard days are in my future. And I don&rsquo;t have a tried-and-true method of dealing with &ldquo;hard&rdquo;. The thing I&rsquo;ve turned to in the past has been food, but I&rsquo;d like to find healthier ways to cope this time around. That being said, I have hope. I&rsquo;ve spent a couple of years living alone and it turns out I&rsquo;ve learned a thing or two!</p>

<p>Building (coding) things brings value to my life. There&rsquo;s nothing quite like sitting down at a computer, staring at a blank screen, and bringing a thing to life. This, of course, is loaded, as most things are for me. Building has been a way to escape. A way to run away from hard (and scary) situations. A way to escape from dealing with my insecurities. And so, there&rsquo;s also a lot of shame. A balance does exist, and now I have ample time to try to find it.</p>

<p>I really enjoy learning from my mentors (Derek Sivers, Jason Fried, Seth Godin, etc). Another way I&rsquo;ve spent alone time in the past is consuming as much content as possible from the handful of people I really care about. I encounter new situations and learn how they handle them. I get exposed to new arguments and ways of thinking about the world. I learn a lot. I haven&rsquo;t spent the past few months doing this and I&rsquo;m itching to pick it back up.</p>

<p><strong>Sadness</strong></p>

<p>Though I have hope (and some experience) dealing with the road ahead I still, at times, experience an overwhelming amount of sadness. And in those times I feel like doing nothing. I feel like laying on the couch and watching TV for hours and hours. But there&rsquo;s also a lot of shame in that. Shame that I&rsquo;m not doing something more. Shame that I feel sad in the first place.</p>

<p>My experience with my therapist over the past few months can be summed up into a couple of words: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t judge the feeling&rdquo;. On a small scale, I think I&rsquo;ve made great progress. I have a much better handle on the daily barrage of thoughts, feelings, and emotions that are driven by my insecurities. I&rsquo;m proud of the progress I&rsquo;ve made. This (the overwhelming sadness) feels different. I don&rsquo;t have a patronus to fight it off before it becomes all-consuming. And I still judge the feeling, when that feeling consumes hours and hours of my day. But, I have hope. During an early conversation I had with my therapist I argued that the best time to learn how to deal with something is in real time, when you&rsquo;re experiencing it. She argued that the best time was before you experience it. I now know I was wrong. Coping with overwhelming emotions requires trained emotional muscles. Thankfully, I started regularly going to the gym a few months ago. I&rsquo;m not yet strong enough. But I&rsquo;m hopeful.</p>

<p><strong>On being comfortable</strong></p>

<p>Figuring out how to find my own comfort, in such uncertainty, will be my primary focus over the next few months. Because I know the reward in doing so will last well into the future. And I have hope. I have hope because I&rsquo;m better equipped. And because I&rsquo;m not going at it alone. Malayna, thank you for being kind, and patient, and full of wisdom.</p>
