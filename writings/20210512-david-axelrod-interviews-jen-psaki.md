In his podcast, The Axe Files with David Axelrod, David Axelrod interviews Jen Psaki, the current White House Press Secretary. 
I thought it was a fascinating look into the life of a Press Secretary, both inside and outside the White House. I particularly 
enjoyed her thoughts on how she has a meaningful relationship with her kids despite her crazy life (~55 minutes in).

From the episode's show notes:

> Press Secretary Jen Psaki didnâ€™t envision herself returning to the White House after serving as Communications Director under 
President Obama, but when President Joe Biden asked her to join his team, she agreed. She now speaks on behalf of the Biden 
administration and holds near-daily press briefings, which she called just the tip of the iceberg of her responsibilities. 
Jen joined David to talk about how the constant flow of information shapes her communication strategy, what the job of press 
secretary actually looks like, why comparisons between the Obama and Biden administrations miss the mark, and her expectation 
for a short-lived stint in her current role.
