I have four mentors.

I have a loose definition of the word “mentor”. They aren't people who I 
can call at any moment, but some of them are. In fact, two of them have 
no clue who I am. But they’re all my mentors because I can predict how 
they’d respond to my questions, I've chatted with them enough or I've 
read enough of their writing.

I didn't call them my mentors until recently. It feels especially weird 
to call someone your mentor when you've never met them. That was until 
I read a blog post by Derek Sivers where [he talks about his mentors](https://sive.rs/ment), 
and they look similar to the people I have in my life. I realized, those four 
people are my mentors. And this idea has been liberating. I don’t have 
to be in the same place, at the same time, with that perfect person, to 
eventually have a “mentor”. I've seen enough of what my mentors have to 
say that I find myself quoting them, to other people, and to myself. 
They’re always there for me, I only need to ask.
