# Podcasts

A list of my favorite podcasts. I don't have enough time to listen to them all,
I'll put down and pick up shows depending on how I feel. Some of my favorite shows I 
haven't listened to in months but my fondness for them hasn't changed. The podcasts
are listed alphabetically to not imply order.
