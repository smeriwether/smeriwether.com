# Hi, I'm Stephen. ðŸ˜€

Hello! At work, I'm a Director at [Sprout Labs](https://sproutlabs.co), a software 
development agency. When I'm not at work, I spend most of my time reading books,
listening to podcasts, or browsing the web.


## My writing

Most of what I write ends up on the [Sprout Labs blog](https://sproutlabs.co/blog). The ideas that don't 
make sense for that blog or aren't fully formed, live here and are listed below.

In early 2019 I decided to make the history of my income public.
