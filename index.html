          I'm building Locally Curated with a friend. We think that a company's bookshelf tells a story, about who they are
          and what they believe. We want to help companies tell that story.

      Hi üëã. Welcome to the basement of my home. If you're curious how I built this site, I have good news! It's open source! Take
      a look at the site on Github here: https://github.com/smeriwether/stephen.fyi.
      At a high level, it's a static site, with TailwindCSS, served via NGINX on a DigitalOcean droplet.
      Enjoy the rest of your ${weekdays[today.getDay()]}.
